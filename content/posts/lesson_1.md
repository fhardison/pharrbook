**Greek words change form to show their function in a sentence and to tell us what or who they refer to.**

This is true of nouns which are the topic of this lesson.

## γραμματική (Grammar)


Nouns are _what_ we talk about.

A noun is a person, place, thing, or idea. The Greek word for a noun is `ὄνομα`, which literally means 'name'. 


Greek nouns change their ending to show:

* how many things they refer to (known as `ἀριθμός` or number), and
* to show their role in the sentence (known as `πτῶσις` or case) 


**New Testament Greek has three ἀριθμοἰ**:{{% sidenote %}}ἀριθμ**οί** is the plural of ἀριθμ**ός**.{{% /sidenote %}}

* `ἑνικός` (singular), which refers to one thing,
* `δυϊκός` (dual), which refers to two things, but is rare to nonexistant in the New Testament, and
* `πληθυντικός` (plural), which refers to more than one thing.

For example, ὄνομα is singular. ὀνόματα is plural. Notice how the ending has changed. In the πλητυντικός there is _τα_.

Now we need to learn `ἔστιν`, which means 'is'. 

We also need to learn `τὀ`, which is a form of the Greek word meaning 'the' that is used when mentioning words. We can think of its meaning as 'The word/phrase ___' when it is used this way. 

Now we can say the following things:

* τὸ ὄνομά ἐστιν ἑνικόν. (The word ὄνομα is singular)
* τὸ ὀνόμα**τά** ἐστι{{% sidenote %}} When ἔστιν comes before a word that starts with a consonant, the _ν_ usually disappears. This is called a movable nu.{{% /sidenote %}} πληθυντικός. (The word ὀνόματα is plural) 
* τὸ ἀριθμ**ὀς** ἐστιν ἑνικόν. 
* τὸ ἀριθμ**οί** ἐστι πληθυντικὀν.  




**Greek nouns are divided into groups based on their endings and the last letter of the stem.** 

This is called their `κλίσις` (declension). 

The stem is what is left after we remove the endings. If the stem of a word ends with _α_, it is κλίσις Α. If it ends with _ο_, it is κλίσις Ο. If it ends with a consonant (σύμφωνον), it is κλίσις σύμφωνον. This is summarized in table below.

| Stem ending | κλίσις | 
|:----|:----|
| α | κλίσις Α | 
| ο | κλίσις Ο |
| σύμφωνον | κλίσις σύμφωνον | 

**Greek nouns have `γένος` (gender) which determines the form of words that modify them.**

We will talk about this more in coming lessons. 

Sometimes a noun's γένος corresponds to biological gender, but often it does not. Greek has three γένη:

* `ἀρσενικόν` (masculine),
* `θηλυκόν` (feminine), and 
* `οὐδέτερον` (neuter).

Now we need to learn our first phrase to discuss a Greek nouns, `ἐπὶ τῆς κλισέως X`, which means 'in the X declension'. We also need to learn the word `ὄ` which means 'that' (as in the man _that_ I saw ...).

The following statements are usually true. 

* ὄνομα ὃ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς κλισέως Α ἔστι θηλυκόν.  (A noun that is in the A-declention is feminine.)
* ὄνομα ὃ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς κλισέως Ο ἔστιν ἀρσενικόν ἢ οὐδέτερον. (A noun that is in the O-declention is masculine or neuter.)
* ὄνομα ὃ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς κλισέως σύμφωνα ἔστιν θηλυκὸν, ἀρσινικόν, ἢ οὐδέτερον. 

We can also say the following things about some words we have already learned:

* τὸ ὄνομά ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς κλισέως Ο. 
* τὸ ὄνομά ἐστιν οὐδέτερον.
* τὸ κλίσις ἐστὶν ἐπὶ τῆς κλισέως Α.{{% sidenote %}}The word κλίσις is in the A declension.{{% /sidenote %}}
* τὸ κλίσις ἐστὶν θηλυκὀν. 


**The πτῶσις of a noun shows its function in the sentence.**

Greek has 5 πτώσεις, but we're going to focus on one in this lesson: `ὀρθή` (nominative).

* `ὀρθή`: usually marks the subject of a sentence

* `κλίσις-A, ὀρθή` nouns often end in `α` or `η` if ἑνικὀν, and `αι` if πληθυντκόν:
    * ζω**ή** - ζω**αί**
    * ἀρχ**ῆ** - ἀρχ**αί**
    * σκοτί**α** - σκοτί**αι**
* `κλίσις-O, ὀρθή` nouns end in `ς` or `ν` if ἑνικὀν, and `οι` or `α` if πληθυντκόν:
    * θεό**ς** - θε**όι** 
    * λογό**ς** - λογ**όι**
    * δὠρο**ν** - δώρ**α**

So we can say the following about these words:

* τὸ ζωή ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς κλίσεως Α. τὸ ζωή ἐστιν ἐνικόν. τὸ ζωή ἐστιν θηλυκὀν. 
* τὸ ἀρχαί ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς κλίσεως Α. τὸ ἀρχαί ἐστιν πληυθντικόν. τὸ ἀρχαί ἐστιν θηλυκόν.
* τὸ θεός ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς κλίσεως Ο. τὸ θεός ἐστιν ἐνικόν. τὸ θεός ἐστιν ἀρσενικόν. 
* τὸ δώρον ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς κλίδεως Ο. τὸ δώρον ἐστιν ἐνικόν. τὸ δώρον ἐστιν οὐδέτερον.

The endings are summarized below.

| |Ο-κλίσις, ἀρσενικόν| Α-κλίσις, θηλυκόν| Ο-κλίσις, οὐδετερόν|
|:---|:-------|:------|:-----|
|ἑνικός |ς | α, η | ν|
|πληθυντικός | οι | αι | α |

## μελετήματα (Exercises)

Read the following: 

* λόγος ἔστιν φῶς.

## Reading

* πρὸς τὸν θεόν 'with God'
* ὁ 'the'

> John 1:1,  Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν, καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος.

## Commentary

**θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος**: This clause is ambiguous. Is the subject _λογός_ or _θεός_? In general, if there are two possibilities and one of them is modified by the article (_ὁ_), then the one with the article is the subject.

## Reflection Questions

* How do two translations translate this verse? 
* Do they expand anything?
* How do they translate λόγος?
