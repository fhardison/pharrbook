    <p>This book is an introduction to New Testament Greek.</p>
<p>It aims to teach Greek through reading John&rsquo;s Gospel, and learning grammar and vocabulary as needed to read, really read, the Greek text. John has a relatively low number of vocabulary items

to learn but is long enough to expose learners to a good deal of content.</p>
<p>One unique feature of this book is that as soon as possible the discussions about Greek will begin to be written in Greek.</p>
<p>The goal of this is to give the learner more exposure to Greek and also to give them the facility to think about Greek grammar and exegesis in Greek. Grammatical terms will be initially glossed in English as well and there is also glossary.</p>
<p>Because this book is centered around reading John&rsquo;s Gospel and using Greek as the language of instruction, there will be some words and phrases that will need to learned before their individual parts are understood.</p>
<p>Also there will be some discussion of how Greek talks about Greek that might otherwise not be included in a New Testament Greek course. None of these things will be particularly difficult for learners who are open to learning methods that focus on comprehensible input.</p>
